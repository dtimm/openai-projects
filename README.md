My attempts at solving OpenAI Gym problems

##### Q-learning CartPole-v0
I implemented a very simple 16-state Q-learning algorithm here. It has moderate
success, but I'm not happy with the tweaks I've made to rewards to get it
there. It could be improved with a decaying chance of random actions and by
increasing the state space (bins or some other method).
